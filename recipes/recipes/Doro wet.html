    <p>Doro wat is a richly spiced, fragrant, and delicious chicken-and-egg stew from Ethiopia and Eritrea.  
        The chicken cooks in a flavour-rich base of slow-cooked onions, berbere, niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter), ginger, and garlic. Hard-boiled eggs go in towards the end for a protein-rich and delightfully low-cost meal fit to feed a small army.</p>

        <ol><h3>Cooking The Onions</h3>
            <p>The onions are very, VERY important to doro wat.  
                They need to be nicely browned in order to make a rich sauce base.  
                To that end (and I can't stress this enough), do not rush the process.  
                That being said, they actually cook faster than you might expect, mainly because they're chopped quite finely.  
                The finer you can mince the onions, the better.
            <p>
                The other important thing to understand is that the onions are cooked in a dry pan, without any oil or water.  Once the onions start to sweat and break down, they'll release liquid into the pan, making them easier to cook - but before this happens, you want to make sure you stir a lot to keep them moving.  Keeping the heat low helps avoid any scorching, but if you're worried that the onions might burn,
                you can toss in a little bit of oil.

        <ol><h3>Finding Spices(Kimem)</h3>
            <p>Most of the spices in this recipe are easy to find at any grocery store.  
                The two important exceptions are berbere (which is covered in the next section), and korarima.  
                Korarima is not commonly found outside of Ethiopian/Eritrean grocery stores, though you can find it online with relative ease.  
                Fortunately, green cardamom makes an excellent substitute.</p>
        </ol>
